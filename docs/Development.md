# How to help

So far, this project has been the solo work of a single person (yours truly).

However, there are many areas where contributions can be made.

For instance, if you are proficient in one or more languages, other than English, you could help a lot by extending the pronunciations lexicons to help correct errors in the default phonemizations produced by the eSpeak engine, or add rules to help resolve the pronunciations of heteronyms (words that are written the same but can be pronounced in different ways depending on their context) based on their context.
