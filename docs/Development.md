# How to help

So far, this project has been the solo work of a single person (yours truly).

However, there are many areas where contributions can be made.

## Reporting any issue or bug you encounter

Especially if you're using the macOS platform, since I don't have access to a macOS machine.

## Reporting odd TTS pronunciations and other fail cases

Though that may be an issue with model training, which should be forwarded to the original authors

## Extending the pronunciation lexicons

Especially if you are proficient in a language other than English. In many cases, the default phonemizations produced by the eSpeak engine are incorrect

You can also add rules to help resolve the pronunciations of heteronyms (words that are written the same but can be pronounced in different ways depending on their context) based on their context.
